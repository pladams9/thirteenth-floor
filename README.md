# Thirteenth Floor

This is a personal project with the goals of 1) creating a basic voxel game engine and 2) building a life simulator game on top of that engine.

The (rather lofty) aim of the simulation is to create a self-sufficient world of autonomous "people" who have emotions, desires, relationships, jobs, etc. The name is taken from the 1999 film [*The Thirteenth Floor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Floor), in which scientists build such a simulation and interact with it by essentially possesing the bodies of the simulation's inhabitants.
